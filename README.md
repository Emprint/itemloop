# 📦 Itemloop – Open Source Inventory Webapp for Community Reuse Centers

## 🌍 Overview

**Itemloop** is a full-stack, multilingual web application for reuse and recycling centers to manage their inventory of second-hand items. It is optimized for collaborative, community-based use, supports desktop and mobile devices, and includes PWA features for offline access.

This project is open source and welcomes contributions under the AGPL v3 license.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | Angular 20+ (standalone components, signals, Angular CDK) |
| Backend | PHP 8.2+ · **Slim Framework 4** |
| Database | MySQL 5.7+ |
| Image processing | Intervention Image (GD driver) — WebP conversion + thumbnails |
| Hosting target | Shared PHP/MySQL hosting (e.g., OVH) — **no SSH required after deploy** |

> ⚠️ The backend was migrated from Laravel to **Slim Framework 4** to allow fully local builds with no post-deploy server-side commands required (no `artisan`, no migrations to run on the server).

## 🚀 Features

- **Product CRUD** — title, description, condition, quantity, estimated value, barcode, dimensions, weight, destination, visibility
- **Product list** — search, multi-filter (category, condition, location), grid/list toggle, pagination, CSV export
- **Product form** — 3-column layout, view mode (read-only) and edit mode
- **Structured locations** — Building → Zone → Shelf with auto-generated, editable codes
- **Image management** — multiple images per product, WebP conversion, thumbnail generation, drag-to-reorder, cover image (first image by sort order)
- **Cart** — add-to-cart with quantity picker (max = available stock) on product view page; cart page with item list, price/line-total columns, grand total, clear and place-order actions; persisted in `localStorage`
- **Dashboard** — KPI cards (total products, total quantity, estimated value) + category donut chart
- **Role-based access** — Customer (browse + cart), Editor (full product/location CRUD), Admin (everything + user management)
- **Public / private visibility** — guests see only public products; editors/admins see all
- **Authentication** — register, login, logout (PHP session-based)
- **User management** (admin only)
- **Multilingual UI** — French + English, auto-detected from browser, manually switchable
- **Comboboxes with inline create** — colors and categories created on the fly
- **Angular CDK drag-and-drop** for image ordering
- **Centralized currency config** — `app-settings.ts` sets the currency code (default: `EUR`) used everywhere

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.2+ with the **GD extension** enabled
- Composer
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- MySQL 5.7+

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Emprint/itemloop.git
cd itemloop
```

### 2. Backend setup

```sh
cd src/backend
composer install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASS
```

> **Tip:** The [DevDB VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=damms005.devdb) lets you browse and query the MySQL database directly from the editor.

Import the database schema (first time only):

```sh
mysql -u youruser -p yourdb < schema.sql
```

Start the backend dev server:

```sh
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

### 3. Frontend setup

```sh
cd src/frontend
npm install
npm start        # runs ng serve → http://localhost:4200
```

The dev server proxies `/api` and `/storage` to `http://localhost:8000` via `proxy.conf.json`.  
If you change `proxy.conf.json`, restart `ng serve` to pick up the new proxy rules.

**Before committing, format and lint:**

```sh
npx prettier --write src
ng lint
```

## 🚢 Deployment (OVH Shared Hosting)

No SSH access is required after uploading files.

```sh
./deploy.sh
```

This script builds the Angular frontend (production mode) and assembles the `deploy_package/` folder. Upload via FTP:

- `deploy_package/frontend/` → your public web root (e.g., `www/`)
- `deploy_package/backend/` → a directory outside the public root (e.g., `api/`)

Configure the backend `.env` on the server with your hosting MySQL credentials.

## 📋 Notes

- **Roles**: Customer (browse public items, cart), Editor (full product/location CRUD), Admin (everything + user management)
- **Password policy**: min 8 characters, at least 1 letter, 1 digit, 1 special character
- **Passwords**: hashed with PHP `password_hash()` (bcrypt / `PASSWORD_DEFAULT`)
- **Sessions**: PHP native session handling (no JWT, no Sanctum)
- **CSRF**: token-based protection on mutating API routes
- **Currency**: configured in `src/frontend/src/app/app-settings.ts` — change `currency: 'EUR'` to any ISO 4217 code
