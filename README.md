## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Emprint/itemloop.git
cd itemloop/src/api
```

### 2. Install backend dependencies
```sh
composer install
```

### 3. Set up environment

**Tip:** Developers can use the [DevDB extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=damms005.devdb) to manage the MySQL database directly from within Visual Studio Code.
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your database credentials:
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` and set `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD`.

### 4. Generate app key
```sh
php artisan key:generate
```

### 5. Run migrations
```sh
php artisan migrate
```

### 6. Start the backend server
For Laravel 11+:
```sh
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

### 7. Frontend setup (Angular)
Navigate to the frontend directory (to be created):
```sh
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
```

**Before committing changes, ensure the solution is formatted and linted:**

```sh
npx prettier --write src
ng lint
```
